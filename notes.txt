When communicating on this project email Sean, KT, Andrew Paquette, and Lisa Abegglen.

Notes from board:

All possible missense from a single nucleotide substitution (~6.5/codon)	~221
All possible 3nt in-frame deletions	102
Alanine scan of frame-0 IFI (in-frame insertion?)	34
Lots of silent barcodes, uniquely associated with each planned mutation!

1. All possible silent permutations (1-34 substitutions)
2. Exclude de novo splice donors
3. Exclude de novo splice acceptors
4. Exclude reduction in 6-mer exon fitness
5. Test for stable secondary RNA structures and excluded

Count remaining barcodes.
6. Score for translation efficiency
7. Assign barcodes to coding variants (iterate tests)


Ideas from KT:

	1. Avoid codons for rare tRNAs	DONE
	2. Avoid homopolymers >5bp (TTTTTT, AAAAAA, etc) because polymerases slip DONE
	3. Avoid di and tri nucleotides repeats greater than 3 units (TATATATA) because polymerases slip
	4. Avoid G guadruplexes (four Gs in a row) because they inhibit oligo synthesis DONE
	5. Avoid strong secondary structure, such as hairpins with Tm > 40.  I know of web-based calculator tools, like UNA fold, but I'm sure there are some C or R packages too. Let me know if you can't find them and I can help search.
	6. Avoid sequences with extremely high or low GC content (<25% or >75%) because polymerases will cause biased representation after PCR	DONE


Would be nice to show how many mutants pass/fail at each filtering step.
